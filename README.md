Only tested on this https://github.com/microwave89-hv/hw-fw-notes/blob/master/hw HW!
Not tested with emulators such as QEMU or VBox!

DO NOT REPLACE ANY EXISTING FILE, SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE THE "BOOTX64.EFI", BY THE "hello-world2".EFI FILE!
OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT RISK BRICKING YOUR COMPUTER!

BROTIP: Fast shutdown with "sudo halt -q" ;)
